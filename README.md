# ITCNE23
This a summary of my learnings during my HF school. The main goal of the school is to teach us about "cloud-native" approaches in the IT business.
We had several modules during the school, which will each get their own subfolder.

For a quick overview, these were the modules:

- NWA1 (Network technologies and architectures)
- AWS (AWS Cloud)
- IaC (Infrastructure as Code, Bash, Cloud-Init)
- PE (Leadership, Communication, Personality development)
- AZURE (AZURE Cloud)
- MAAS (Private Cloud [MAAS.io](https://maas.io/))
- PRJ (Projectmanagement (Overview, Agil, Scrum))
