# Introduction
In this exercise, we had the instruction to create some Azure ressources.
We had to do it once over the "manual" way, meaning over the webinterface of Azure.
Once over the "Azure CLI" and once more over the "Powershell CMDlets".

For a more detailed instruction, revert to the original source [here](https://gitlab.com/ch-tbz-wb/Stud/azure/-/blob/main/2_Unterrichtsressourcen/Auftraege/Ressource%20erstellen.md) 

# Manual Way

Over the manual it's rather simple, everything is clickable and leads you directly to the desired function.

# With Azure CLI



# With Powershell CMDlets
